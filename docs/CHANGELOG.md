# WaPay — Changelog

*One dated section per meaningful commit, newest first. This local working copy has no `.git`, so history is reconstructed from `WAPAY_BUILD_TRACKER.md` and the known deploy commits; dates marked ~ are approximate (the commit hash is exact, the day is the tracker's). Keep this file updated per commit going forward — that is the version-control discipline the repo is held to.*

## 2026-08-18 — `6096585` — Mute-bot fix: await processing before ACK

The deployed webhook ACKed 200 to Meta and then processed the message in a fire-and-forget async block. Vercel serverless kills work after the response, so processing never ran and the bot went silent after the `44b51c9` deploy. This commit restores the correct ordering — verify signature → process the message (awaited) → ACK — and hardens it: the static wiring test now enforces the ordering and bans void-async in the webhook. Also gives the user-manager prisma import a `.js` extension so local simulation matches production module resolution. Bot confirmed working by the founder the same evening.

## ~2026-08-17 — `44b51c9` — Semantic search layer + OTT issuing client

Two additions (deployed to Vercel 2026-08-18):

- **Semantic search**: pgvector migration, `lib/vas-embeddings.js`, and `hybridProductSearch` in `lib/vas-search.js` — semantic-first product search with lexical fallback. 854/854 products were subsequently embedded (text-embedding-3-small) and live-verified. Not yet wired into the chat free-text path.
- **OTT client** (`@wapay/providers-ott`): voucher issuing client with `getVoucher / checkVoucher / confirmVoucher / rejectVoucher`, deterministic references, enforced timeout recovery (`TIMEOUT_CHECK_REQUIRED`), AUTH/USER_INPUT/RETRYABLE error taxonomy, and `GetAPIKey` protected (it rotates the live key). Sandbox GetBalance verified live.

## ~2026-08-16 — `83a68fe` — Voucher template rename

Recipient-notification template aligned to `wapay_voucher_received` (created in Meta, category Utility, pending approval). This is the template that lets gift/voucher notifications reach numbers that have never messaged the bot.

## ~2026-08-16 — `f9b52eb` — Catalog endpoint fix

The VAS catalog sync was calling a dead Blu endpoint and silently importing only 20 products. Fixed the endpoint; catalog went from 20 to 831 products. Account reset tooling added alongside.

## 2026-08-15 — `2360f18` — Money-safe ledger, webhook security, gifting

The foundation commit:

- **Ledger**: `lib/ledger-core.js` (chart of accounts, fee model, balanced-entry builders) + `lib/ledger-post.js` (atomic idempotent `postEntry`, `reserveHold/settleHold/releaseHold`, `claimMessage` dedupe, reconciliation) + Prisma migration `20260810_ledger_core` (two-tier wallets, unique idemKey, holds, processed_messages, CHECK constraints). Later verified 21/21 against the live DB.
- **Webhook security**: HMAC signature verification over the raw body wired into `pages/api/webhooks/whatsapp.js` (401 before ACK), leaked fallback verify-token removed, per-message dedupe.
- **Money-safe refactor**: airtime (reference pattern), then data and electricity execute routes moved onto ensureWallet → reserveHold → provider → settleHold/releaseHold; balance endpoint fixed (SPEND wallet, 503 on DB failure); preview routes gated behind internal auth.
- **Gifting** (`lib/gifting.js`): the V1 wedge — send airtime/data to another number as a SPEND (goods), never a transfer; bare cash-send refused and redirected; recipient notification template-aware.

## Before 2026-08-15 — pre-history (January baseline)

The original V1.01 build: WhatsApp onboarding (OTP, PIN, consent templates), Blu voucher redemption for wallet load, Blu VAS vending (airtime/data/electricity), single gpt-4o chat, Vercel deployment. Stable but money-unsafe (non-atomic flows, unsigned webhook) — the problems the 2026-08-15 commit exists to fix. See `docs/BUGLOG.md` for the specific defects found and closed.
